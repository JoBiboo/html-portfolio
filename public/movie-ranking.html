<h1>The Best Movies According to Saram</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Stardust</h3>
<p>This is my FAVORITE movie! It's so much fun to watch. The character development of the main character shows him going from nerdy turd to nerdy and suave.</p>

<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>Belle is my favorite princess. She was the first one to not fall in love with a handsome man.</p>

<h3>The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>A love of Hobbits, Elves, adventure, and magic. What more could you ask for in a movie.</p>
